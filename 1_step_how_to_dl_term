dl cygwin for windows : https://cygwin.com/index.html or just launch the script_install_term

!! I suggest u to install development packages after installing Cygwin:
1 . Launch the Cygwin installer:
Open the Windows Start menu and search for "Cygwin Setup".
Launch the "Cygwin Setup.exe" application.
2 . Select the development packages:
Click on the "Categories" button in the top left corner and expand the "Development" category (if u want to install ALL U NEED FOR DEV select the button next to default and select install then restart your term)
Browse and check the boxes of the packages you want to install, for example "gcc-core", "g++", "make", etc.
You can also search and install other development packages depending on your needs.
3 . Download and install the packages:
Click on the "Next" button to download and install the selected packages.
4 . Restart your Cygwin terminal:
Once the installation is complete, restart your Cygwin terminal for the changes to take effect.
Verify the installation:
You can verify the installation by running the following command in your Cygwin terminal:
gcc --version
If the command executes successfully, it will display the version of GCC installed.
